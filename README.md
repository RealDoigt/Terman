# Terman
Terman (terminal + pacman), is an old pacman clone project which was originally made for a programming tutorial series (It was abandonned). If anyone is willing to translate the code's names for functions, variables, classes, etc. from french to english and/or continue the project into something more than an unfinished demo, it would be great. Please contact me on the Boo discord or open an issue if you're willing to take ownership of this repo.
